# SEECRS-POX-C
R script for calculating POX-C from raw data based on SEECRS lab protocol

Includes example data, metadata, and final dataset. POX-C calculation pipeline is complete but analysis pipeline is incomplete as of 3/30/22. 

You need to do a little, simple prep work before using this script! For reading raw data from excel sheets using the plater package, see our SEECRS-ReadInPlateData script https://github.com/emmalink1/ReadInPlateData.
